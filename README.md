# An Intro to Database Sharding

The `controller.py` file in this repository takes the file named `chapter2.txt` and emulates a simple horizontally sharded database, allowing easy understanding of how data is distributed across nodes. This particular handler is unfinished; it can initialize nodes and add nodes to an initialized list, but it cannot remove nodes or handle replication. That is an exercise for the reader.
